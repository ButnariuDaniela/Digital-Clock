# Digital-Clock
Digital Clock

This project is made for "JS Fundamentals cours" - Telecom Academy. I used:
•	Java Scripts (variables, functions, decisional structure, class, Date objects),
•	HTML (create structure with difrent tags, link css file, link script js file)
•	CSS concepts (applaying style at general level, at class level, at id level, border, size, color, set an image as background, create animataion with @keyframes).

The result is an animated, beautiful digital clock with a friendly interface.
